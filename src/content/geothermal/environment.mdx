When it comes to carbon emissions,
geothermal energy is among the most efficient options—it produces 10 times less $$CO_{2}$$ than coal!
However, it still is not as efficient as [solar energy](/solutions/solar/), as it produces roughly 3× more $$CO_{2}$$!
Possibly the biggest issue with geothermal infrastructure, though, is the land it takes to build.
The building of larger plants can often disrupt ecosystems,
but this effect comes with all types of energy
and is mitigated though with smaller systems such as ones installed on houses.
