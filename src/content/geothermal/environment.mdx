When it comes to carbon emissions, geothermal energy is very efficient.
It produces 10 times less $$CO_{2}$$ than coal!
But it still isnâ€™t as efficient as solar as it produces roughly 3x more $$CO_{2}$$.
Possibly the biggest issue with geothermal though is the land it takes to build the infrastructure.
The building of larger plants can often disrupt ecosystems but this effect comes with all types of energy.
This effect is mitigated though with smaller systems such as ones installed on houses.
