Geothermal systems use heat energy captured from within the Earth for things such as
heating, cooking, and even electricity.
The most fascinating part of geothermal energy is that it is all around us.
This form of energy can be captured just about anywhere on the planet!
If we harnessed all of it, there would be enough to power the Earth 3 times over!
That is an incredible amount of energy.
Of course, it is important to remember that geothermal energy is not a new concept.
Humans have been using it for over 10,000 years for heating
hot springs, cooking, and even space heating in ancient cities like Pompeii!
Nowadays, geothermal systems are mainly used for heating;
however, if you also install a converter, it can also generate electricity.
Due to this, many large universities such as Yale, Brown, and Missouri S&T have installed geothermal systems to power their campuses.
The switch to geothermal is still beginning, but investing now will be a valuable investment in the future.

There are four types of geothermal energy solutions.

1. Horizontal loop: Horizontal loop systems are best for properties with more land, as they are bigger and require deeper trenches.
2. Vertical Loop: Vertical loop systems are narrow and great for residential areas!
3. Closed Loop: Closed loop systems mix water and antifreeze to accommodate cold climates, making them optimal for northern locations.
4. Open Loop: Open loop systems circulate water from an outside source, meaning they are optimal for properties with a steady water source.
