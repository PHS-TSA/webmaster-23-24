Geothermal energy is heat energy captured from within the earth and is then used for various things such as heating, cooking, and even electricity.
What’s fascinating about geothermal energy is that it’s all around us.
Just about anywhere on the planet this energy can be captured. If we were to harness all of it, it would be enough to power the earth 3 times over.
That’s an incredible amount of energy.
However, it’s important to remember that geothermal energy isn’t a new concept.
Humans have been using it for over 10,000 years for functions such as heating hot springs, cooking, and even space heating in cities such as Pompeii.
Nowadays, it’s still mainly used for heating; however, if you install a converter, it can also be used for electricity.
Due to this many large universities such as Yale, Brown, and Missouri S&T have been installing geothermal systems to power their campuses.
The switch to geothermal is still beginning but it will be a worthy investment for the future.
