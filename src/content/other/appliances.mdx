Nowadays, electric appliances are fairly commonplace.
Instead of using natural gas, they use electricity to power themselves. 
This reduces emissions as natural gas produces large amounts of carbon due to its extraction and transportation. 
Electric appliances such as stoves can also be safer as they reduce the chance of fire.
But what can you do? Well, the next time one of your appliances breaks replace it with an electric one.
It won't cost you much more and can even save you money on bills.
