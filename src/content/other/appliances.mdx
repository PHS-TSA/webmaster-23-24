Electric appliances are fairly commonplace nowadays.
Instead of using natural gas, they use electricity to power themselves.
This reduces emissions, as natural gas produces large amounts of carbon due to its extraction and transportation.
Electric appliances like stoves can also be safer as they reduce the chance of fire.
What can you do?
Next time one of your appliances breaks, try replacing it with an electric one.
It won’t cost you much more upfront and can even save you money on bills.
