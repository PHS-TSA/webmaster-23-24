While nuclear energy may not be green it's still an incredible source of energy and controversy.
On one hand, it provides a near-infinite source of energy.
On the other hand, the same was said of coal until recently, and the waste from fission can be far worse than the waste from coal.
But with proper regulation, it can do wonders. For example, nearly all modern US Navy vessels are nuclear-powered.
Nuclear power allows the ships to stay out at sea for months and also produce less carbon emissions. 
Overall, nuclear energy is still developing but could be a powerful resource in the future.
