Many companies offer online billing options that allow you to pay digitally.
By signing up for these programs, you reduce your paper consumption and, therefore, tree felling.
Fewer trees chopped down means more trees sucking carbon out of the air and reducing your carbon footprint!
Often, online billing is also far more convenient.
Many companies offer features called autopay or EZ-Pay,
which take money directly out of your account when the bill is due.
This can help you avoid late fees and, sometimes, companies will even give you a discount if you enable it.
However, be waryâ€”
some online services will automatically charge more than you budgeted for if you go over your usage tier.
