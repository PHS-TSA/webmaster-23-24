Many companies offer online billing, which are programs that allow you to pay digitally.
By signing up for these programs, you reduce your paper consumption and, therefore, reduce the felling of trees.
Fewer trees chopped down means more trees reducing your carbon footprint!
In many cases, online billing can also be far more convenient.
Most companies offer features called autopay or EZ Pay, which will take money directly out of your account when the bill is due.
This can help you avoid late fees and, in some cases, companies will even give you a discount if you enable it.
However, be wary, for some online services will automatically charge more than you budgeted for if you go over your usage tier.
