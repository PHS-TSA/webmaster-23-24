Biomass is biodegradable organic material that comes from plants, animals, agricultural waste, and forestry.
This material is then burned, similar to fossil fuels, but is carbon neutral due to the carbon dioxide removed during the plantâ€™s life.
This process is very efficient, as it uses resources such as trash that we already have but otherwise go unused.
By making use of this material, we can reduce fossil usage and move towards a greener future.
