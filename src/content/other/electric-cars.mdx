Transportation is one of the largest sources of carbon emissions in the United States.
Therefore, it comes as no surprise that people find the appeal of electric vehicles very real.
Electric cars are much more efficient than traditional vehicles when it comes to carbon emissions per mile,
as they run on electricity rather than gasoline.
In America, right now is a fantastic time to invest in an EV,
as many pieces of legislation are currently getting passed to promote them.
Also, all major electric car brands now support the Tesla supercharger network,
so charging is less of a worry than ever!
Consumers who purchase EVs are eligible for a $7,500 tax credit on new EVs or a $4,000 tax credit for used EVs.
Moreover, some states like California have made plans to ban the sale of all new gas-powered vehicles by 2035.
Therefore, it is important to start thinking about the future of transportation.
Will your vehicle still be legal in eight years?
Overall, now is a great time to invest in an electric vehicle!
