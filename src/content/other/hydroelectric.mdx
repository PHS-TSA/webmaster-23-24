While not as green as other initiatives due to its environmental effects,
hydroelectric power is still a great source of electricity.
Hydropower has been used in the United States for nearly one hundred years, introduced as a key part of FDR’s New Deal legislation.
To this day ew dams are still being built—it’s a popular source of renewable energy!
The biggest issue with hydroelectric power systems is their impact on local ecosystems.
It is often reported that dams obstruct fish migration, cause floods, and more.
Overall, hydropower is a great renewable resource for the now, while we’re still migrating to renewables,
it’s just not one that will power an even cleaner and greener future.
You may wish to consider investing in other, more future-proof renewable energy sources.
