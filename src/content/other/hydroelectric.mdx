{/* Is the Hypostatic Union joke too bad? */}

While not as green as other initiatives due to its environmental effects, hydropower is still a great source of electricity.
Hydropower has been used in the US for nearly 100 years. It was a key part of New Deal legislation and new dams are still being built to this day.
The biggest issue with hydropower though is its impact on local ecosystems. It is reported that dams may obstruct fish migration, cause floods, and more.
Overall, hydropower is a great resource just not the one that will power a green future.
