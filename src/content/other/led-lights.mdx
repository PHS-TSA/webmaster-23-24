In the past 15 years or so LED lights have nearly replaced traditional light bulbs. 
This is due to a couple of big factors. 
To start, LED lights use 90% less energy than traditional light bulbs and last 25x longer! By using less energy you reduce your carbon emissions. 
In most cases, they're the same price as traditional light bulbs so by not buying them you're basically losing money.
In conclusion, if you haven't invested in LED light bulbs yet they're definitely worthwhile.
