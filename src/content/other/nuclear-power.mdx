While nuclear energy may not be green, it's still an incredible source of both energy and controversy.
On one hand, it provides a near-infinite source of energy.
On the other hand, the same was said of coal until recently, and the waste from fission is far more dangerous to the environment than the waste from coal when improperly disposed of.
However, it can do wonders with proper regulation.
For example, nearly all modern US Navy vessels are nuclear-powered.
Nuclear power allows the ships to stay out at sea for months while emitting far less carbon.
Overall, nuclear energy is still developing, but could be a powerful resource in the future.
