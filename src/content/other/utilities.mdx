Electric companies offer programs where you can choose to specifically buy green energy.
Ameren, for example, offers a “Community Solar” program,
where you pay a $25 fee to help build solar panels,
and then they guarantee you only get green energy.
Yes, this will slightly increase your energy bills,
but it will push power companies to do what’s right and help the environment.
