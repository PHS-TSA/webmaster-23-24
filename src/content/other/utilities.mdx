Electric companies such as Ameren offer programs where you can choose to specifically buy green energy.
In the case of Ameren, they offer a “Community Solar” program, where you pay a $25 fee to help build solar panels and then they guarantee you get green energy.
Yes, this will increase your energy bills slightly, but it will push power companies to do what’s right and help the environment.
