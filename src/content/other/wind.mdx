While not readily available for American consumers, wind power is still a great source of green energy.
Wind turbines create energy by transforming the kinetic energy of the spinning blades into electrical energy that can be used to power communities.
The only carbon emissions produced by wind turbines are the ones produced during their production.
Once theyâ€™re up, they are 100% green.
The only real issue with wind turbines is they can sometimes disrupt local ecosystems, especially for birds, but national and local wildlife conservatories are actively working to diminish the effects of wind power on local wildlife.
You can help promote wind power in your community by calling your local representatives and asking them to take action.
