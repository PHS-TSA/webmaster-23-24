The cost to collect, transport, clean, and process recycled material can vary anywhere from $100 to $300 per ton!
However, the cost to recycle is not a complete loss: recycled materials that are made into new products and sold help make money back.

It was reported that in Atlantic County, New Jersey, the sale of goods made from recycled material generated $2.45 million, while the cost of processing the recycled materials cost the county over $3 million.
