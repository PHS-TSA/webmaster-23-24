Recycling is the process of taking inorganic waste materials and turning them into new products.
These materials include paper, glass, metal, and plastic.
Recyclable material is collected by consumers and businesses, which is then collected by private or government entities.
The material is then sorted, cleaned, processed, and shipped to manufacturing facilities to be made into new products.
