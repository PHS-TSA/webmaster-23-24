Recycling is the process of taking inorganic waste materials and turning them into new products.
These materials include paper, glass, metal, and plastic.
Recyclable material is collected by consumers and businesses, which is then collected by private or government entities.
The material is then sorted, cleaned, processed, and shipped to manufacturing facilities to be made into new products.

What’s fascinating about recycling though is that many technologies such as solar panels and wind turbines are made from recycled materials.
We’re using green practices to create green products, which is a win-win for both the environment and the economy.
By recycling materials, we can reduce the amount of raw materials we need to mine/produce which in turn causes less carbon emissions.
