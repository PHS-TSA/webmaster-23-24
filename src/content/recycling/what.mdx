Recycling is the process of taking inorganic waste and turning it into new products.
Recyclable materials include paper, glass, metal, and plastic.
They are collected by consumers and businesses.
Then, it is collected by private or government entities and sent to a recycling facility.
The material is then sorted, cleaned, processed, and shipped to manufacturing facilities where it is made into new products.

What is truly fascinating about recycling, though,
is that many technologies such as solar panels and wind turbines are made from recycled materials.
That’s right, we’re using green practices to create green products:
a win-win for both the environment and economy!
By recycling materials,
we can reduce the amount of raw material we need to mine and produce, which in turn reduces our carbon emissions.
