While the monetary cost to recycle materials is a net loss, the benefits clearly outweigh the costs.
In 2018, 69.1 million tons of waste was recycled in the U.S., saving million tons of waste from entering landfills and saving over 193 million tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere.
Recycling also generates tax revenue, as well as hundreds of thousands of jobs.
