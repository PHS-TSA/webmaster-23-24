---

While the monetary cost of recycling materials is a net loss, the benefits outweigh the costs.
In 2018, 69.1 million tons of waste was recycled in the U.S.,
saving millions of tons of waste from entering landfills
and saving over 193 million tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere.
Recycling also generates tax revenue, as well as hundreds of thousands of jobs.
For most citizens, there is little reason not to recycle,
as the cost is already taken out of their trash fees.
It can even be profitable due to bottle laws!
Overall, it is worth it to learn about and begin recycling,
as it is a simple way to help the environment and your local economy.
