The best thing about solar power is that it has nearly zero negative effects on the environment!
It doesnâ€™t produce greenhouse gasses and has little effect on local wildlife.
They can be placed on rooftops, which means that they are incredibly space-efficient.
The only harmful effect of solar power on the environment is its production.
A major component of solar panels is lithium, which is plagued by unsustainable mining practices.
Nevertheless, such effects on the environment are negligible, as many solar panels are made using [recycled materials](/solutions/recycling/), and progress is being made to make lithium mining considerably more sustainable and ethical.
