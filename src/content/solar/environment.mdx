The best thing about solar power is it has nearly zero negative effects on the environment.
It doesn't produce greenhouse gasses and has little effect on local wildlife.
The only part of solar that somewhat harms the environment is its production.
They're made of lithium, which is plagued by unsustainable mining practices.
Nevertheless, such effects on the environment are negligible, as many solar panels are made using [recycled materials](/solutions/recycling) and progress is being made to make lithium mining more sustainable and ethical.
