The best thing about solar power is that it has nearly zero negative effects on the environment!
It doesn’t produce greenhouse gasses and has minimal effect on local wildlife.
They can be placed on rooftops, which means that they are incredibly space-efficient.
The only harmful effect of solar power on the environment is its production.
A major component of solar panels is lithium, which is plagued by unsustainable mining practices.
Nevertheless, the effects on the environment are negligible,
as many solar panels are made using [recycled materials](/solutions/recycling/),
and progress is being made to make lithium mining considerably more sustainable and ethical.
