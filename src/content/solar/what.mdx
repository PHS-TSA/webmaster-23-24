Solar power is a fascinating technology that converts energy from the sun into electricity.
It is a renewable and near infinite resource as the sun isn't expected to run out of energy for billions of years to come.
Unlike coal and oil, it doesn't emit greenhouse gasses, meaning that it doesn't contribute to global warming.
Nowadays, solar power is used for powering a wide array of things, from satellites to homes.
The government has also been working on constructing solar farms, where thousands of solar panels are connected together to power an energy grid.

<Admonition type="note" title="Did you know?">
  Solar power was first harnessed in 700 B.C.E by the Greeks and Romans, who
  used the sun's rays reflections off objects like mirrors to light fires.
