Solar power is a fascinating technology that converts energy from the sun into electricity.
It is a renewable and near infinite resource as the sun isn’t expected to run out of energy for billions of years to come.
Unlike coal and oil, it doesn’t emit greenhouse gasses, meaning that it doesn’t contribute to global warming.
Nowadays, solar power is used for powering a wide array of things, from satellites to homes.
The government has also been working on constructing solar farms, where thousands of solar panels are connected together to power an energy grid.

<Admonition type="fun-fact">
  Solar power was first harnessed circa 213 B.C.E by the Greeks, who allegedly
  reflected the sun’s rays with mirrors to light enemy ships on fire during the
  Siege of Syracuse.
