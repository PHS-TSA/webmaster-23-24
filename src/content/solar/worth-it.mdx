Overall, solar panels are a worthwhile investment for most homeowners.

While the cost of entry is fairly high, they pay themselves off after around nine to twelve years.
This does depend on the region you live in, and the model of solar panel you purchase.
Monocrystalline solar panels, for example, are more expensive, but last longer and are more energy efficient.
On the other hand, Polycrystalline panels are much cheaper, but don’t last as long and are not nearly as efficient.
Due to their cheaper price, polycrystalline panels are very popular in residential areas.
More often than not, your region will have a much greater impact than the type of solar panels.
In places like Arizona, your panels will get more hours of sunlight and therefore generate more energy.
Sunnier regions also tend to have more legislation that supports solar panels, like tax rebates.
Even if you don’t live in one of those areas, there’s still a 30% federal tax credit on _all_ solar energy systems.
In conclusion, solar panels are an amazing investment that can help your budget and the environment.
