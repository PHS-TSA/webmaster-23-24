Overall, solar panels are a worthwhile investment for most homeowners.

Their cost of entry is fairly high, but they do pay themselves off= after around 9 to 12 years.
This does depend on the region you live in and the model of solar panel you purchase.
Monocrystalline solar panels, for example, are more expensive but last longer and are more energy efficient.
Polycrystalline panels, on the other hand, are much cheaper; however, they don’t last as long and are not nearly as efficient.
Due to their cheaper price, polycrystalline panels are very popular for residential areas.
More often than not, your region will have a much greater impact than the type of solar panels.
In places like Arizona, your panels will get more hours of sunlight and therefore generate more energy.
Sunnier regions also tend to have more legislation that support solar panels, such as tax rebates.
Even if you don’t live in one of those areas, there’s still a 30% federal tax credit on _all_ solar systems.
In conclusion solar panels are a amazing investment that can help your budget and the environment
